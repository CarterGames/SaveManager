This is the more compilcated contribution as you need to follow bigger guides and understanding how the asset functions behind the scenes. While I'm open to code changes, they may take longer to be accepted.

To make a code change you MUST follow the following guidelines:

- Follow the Carter Games commit message guide for your commits which can be found here: https://carter.games/commit-emoji-guide/
- Honour the Carter Games commitment to no AI usage. Any AI generated code will be rejected regardless of how useful it may be to the project. If you've used AI for other projects you may find your contributions denied even if you didn't use AI for your contribution. See the Carter Games stance on AI here: https://carter.games/ai-policy/
- Provide documentation on your new changes or notes on what needs updating in the documentation to support your changes.

- Fork the repository.
- Make your changes in your fork.
- Create a PR merging your changes into the **contribution** branch (https://github.com/CarterGames/SaveManager/tree/contribution). Your PR should explain what it adds to the project.
- Your code will be reviewed and if all good will be merged into the **contribution** branch.
